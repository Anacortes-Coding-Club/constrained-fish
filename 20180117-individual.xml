            <text>The symbol $R_k$ stands for an integer whose base-ten representation is a sequence
                of $k$ ones. For example, $R_3 = 111$, $R_5 = 11111$, etc. When $R_{24}$ is divided
                by $R_4$, the quotient $Q = \frac{R_{24}}{R_4}$ is an integer whose base-ten
                representation is a sequence containing only ones and zeros. The number of zeros in
                $Q$ is:</text>
