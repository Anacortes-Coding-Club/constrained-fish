        <question id="1">
            <text>If $x = \sqrt{2024}$ and $y = \sqrt{2025}$,
                what is the simplified numerical value of $(x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2$?</text>
        </question>

        <solution>
            <!-- <text>8098.</text> -->
            <text>
                Expanding and combining terms,
                $(x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2 = 2x^2+2y^2 = 2(x^2+y^2) = 2(2024 + 2025) = 8098$.

        <question id="2">
            <text>Which is larger, $2^{3000}$ or $3^{2000}$? Bonus: by how much?</text>
        </question>
        <solution>
            <text>
                Since $2^{3000} = (2^3)^{1000}$ and $3^{2000} = (3^2)^{1000}$,
                we only need to compare $2^3$ and $3^2$. Since $2^3 \lt 3^2$, $3^{2000}$ is larger.
                How much larger? $(\dfrac{3^2}{2^3})^{1000}$ is quite a lot
                ($\approx 1.42 \times 10^{51}$), and that's just the ratio!
                Given the ratio is so immense, the difference is approximately the larger number,
                $3^{2000} - 2^{3000} \approx 3^{2000}$.

        <question id="3">
            <text>I draw a line in the coordinate plane starting at $(0,0)$ and going to $(0,1)$.
                I then turn 90 degrees to the right and proceed a distance of .5.
                I then turn 90 degrees to the right and proceed a distance of .25.
                If I continue this process of turning 90 degrees to the right and then drawing
                half the distance that I have just traveled indefinitely,
                at what point, $(x,y)$ form, will I end up?</text>
        </question>

            <text>
                The motion alternates between vertical and horizontal movements,
                shrinking each time by a factor of $\dfrac{1}{2}$.
                The first move is vertical, up 1.
                The third move is also vertical, down $\dfrac{1}{4}$.
                The vertical moves continue, alternating between up (+) and down (-):
                $y = 1-\dfrac{1}{4}+\dfrac{1}{16}- \cdots$.
                The horizontal moves alternate between right (+) and left (-):
                $x = \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{32} - \cdots$.
                These are both geometric series with a common ratio $r$ and initial term $a$.
                The sum of these infinite geometric series is: $S = \dfrac{a}{1-r}$.
                For the vertical component, $a = 1$ and $r = -\dfrac{1}{4}$.
                For horizontal, $a = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and $r = -\dfrac{1}{4}$.
                So, $y = \dfrac{1}{1 - (-\frac{1}{4})} = \dfrac{4}{5}$ and
                $x = \dfrac{\frac{1}{2}}{1-(-\frac{1}{4})} = \dfrac{2}{5}$
                The point at which the path converges is:
                $(x, y) = (\dfrac{2}{5}, \dfrac{4}{5})$
