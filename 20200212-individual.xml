        <question>
            <text>Mrs. Murphy gave an exam in a mathematics class of five students. She entered the
                scores in random order into a spreadsheet, which recalculated the class average
                after
                each score was entered. She noticed that after each score was entered, the average
                was
                always an integer. Interesting! The scores (listed in ascending order) were 71, 76,
                80,
                82, and 91. What was the last score that Mrs. Murphy entered into the spreadsheet?</text>
