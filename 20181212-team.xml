            <text>Together, Al, Barb, Cal, Di, and Ed earned a total of $150, but in unequal
                amounts. In order to equalize their earnings exactly, Barb gave half of her earnings
                to Al. Next, Cal gave one-third of his earnings to Barb. Then, Di gave one-fourth of
                her earnings to Cal. Finally, Ed gave one-sixth of his earnings to Di. How many
                dollars did Al earn before equalization?</text>

                hour. A wristwatch gets 2 minutes ahead of the alarm clock in an hour. At noon, all
                four timepieces were set correctly. To the nearest minute, what time will the
