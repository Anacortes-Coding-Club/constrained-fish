            <text>What are all integers $k$ for which $x^2 + kx + k + 17 = 0$ has integral roots?</text>
        </question>
        <solution>
            <text>
                answer #1
                $k(x+1) = -x^2-17$
                $$k = \frac{-x^2-17}{x+1}$$
                $(x+1)(-x+1) = -x^2+1$
                $$k = \frac{(x+1)(-x+1) -1-17}{x+1}$$
                $$k = 1-x-\frac{18}{x+1}$$
                So x+1 must cleanly divide 18, $x+1 = \pm1,2,3,6,9,18 \implies x = 0, 1, \pm2, -3,
                -4, 5, -7, 8, -10 ,17 ,-19$
                Solve for k. $k=-17, -9, -7, 11, 13, 21$

            <text>In the diagram, one side of a 30° inscribed angle is the diameter of a semicircle
                of radius 3. What is the perimeter of the shaded region bounded by the inscribed
                angle and its intercepted arc?</text>
        </question>
        <answer>
            $6 + 3\sqrt{3} + \pi$
        </answer>
        <solution>
            <text>Inscribed angle is half of intercepted arc (central angle)
                so the arc is 60 degrees, and the arc length is 60/360 x circumference, or pi.
                next, draw the chord for the arc, and we have a right triangle.
                cos x = adj/hyp: $\cos(30)$ is $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so side is $3\sqrt{3}$
            </text>
            <text>
                Perimeter is base + hypotenuse + arc, or $6+3\sqrt{3}+\pi$

            <text>A wall clock loses 2 minutes in an hour. A table clock gets 2 minutes ahead of the
                wall clock in an hour. An alarm clock falls 2 minutes behind the table clock in an
                hour. A wristwatch gets 2 minutes ahead of the alarm clock in an hour. At noon, all
                four timepieces were set correctly. To the nearest minute, what time will the
                wristwatch show when the correct time is 7:00 p.m.?</text>
        </question>
        <solution>
            <text>in 1 hour, wall clock ticks 58min (60 minutes IRL)
                when the wall clock shows 60 minutes, the table clock shows 62 minutes.
                then in 58 wall-clock minutes, the table clock ticks 58 x 62/60 = 60.0667 minutes.
                when the table clock shows 60 minutes, alarm clock shows 58.
                so in $58 \times 62/60 \times 58/60 = 57.93\overline{5}$ minutes
                one more, $58 \times \frac{62}{60} \times \frac{58}{60} \times \frac{62}{60} =
                59.866\overline{741}$ minutes
                so we lose .133 minutes per hour.</text>

        <question id="5">
            <text>Find all ordered pairs of the real numbers $(x, y)$ that satisfy
                $x+y+\sqrt{(x+y)}=56$ and $x-y+\sqrt{(x-y)}=30$.</text>
        </question>
        <solution>
            <text>
                Let $a = \sqrt{x+y}$ and $b = \sqrt{x-y}$. Then the equations become $a^2+a = 56$
                and
                $b^s+b=30$ which we can factor to be $(a+8)(a-7) = 0$ and $(b+6)(b-5) = 0$. So,
                a=-8, 7
                and b=-6, 5. But since a and b are square roots, they are positive, so $\sqrt{(x+y)}
                =
                7$ and $\sqrt{(x-y)} = 5$. Square both sides, and $x+y = 49$ and $x-y = 25$.
                x = y+25
                $x+x-25 = 49 \implies
                x = 37, y=12$.
